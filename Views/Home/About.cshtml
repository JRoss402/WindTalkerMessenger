		<h1>History of the Agent Correspondance Terminal</h1>
		<h2>Powered by Wind Talker Technology Inc.</h2>
		<p>
			Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, 
			the Department of Defense found itself needing a secure channel for agents 
			to communicate effectively. Unknown to the public, in addition to the 
			plane attacks, a shadow cyber campaign had been launched against the U.S. Government. 
			This shadow campaign exposed multiple agents by bypassing the DoD’s cybersecurity 
			infrastructure and gaining access to their databases and files. After this breach, 
			the Department of Defense conferred with congressional members in multiple top-secret 
			meetings and successfully secured funding for the creation of “The Terminal”. 
			This funding was stipulated in both the USA PATRIOT Act and from the allocation of funds 
			from the DoD’s dark pools. With this new funding, the DoD, while collaborating with DARPA, 
			began their design and implementation of “The Terminal”. For the encryption infrastructure, 
			the DoD and DARPA had to consult a private contractor under the 
			shell corporation title of Wind Talker Technology Inc.
			<br />
			<br />
			Your correspondances are considered top-secret if they are sent through
			this terminal. Because of the top-secret clearance required for use of this
			terminal, you will NOT be held responsible for any information exchanged
			between you and another agent. If you suspect that the agent in which
			you are corresponding with has been compromised, contact your headquarters
			immediately and attempt to gather as much intel as possible without tipping
			off the alleged double-agent. If you suspect that YOU have been compromised,
			activate the kill switch to erase all message history. If you
			are accessing this terminal without the proper clearance, you have already
			been identified and the authorities will be intercepting you shortly. Have a nice day!
